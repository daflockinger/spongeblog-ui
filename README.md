# Spongeblog UI - Blogging UI for spongeblogSP

A simple blogging UI:
- Built with Spring and Thymeleaf. 
- Styled with Marterialize CSS and jQuery. 
- Secured with Spring Security and OpenId-Connect. 
- Connects seamlessly to the [spongeblogSP](https://github.com/daflockinger/spongeblogSP) blogging backend, secured with HTTP auth
(should be enough if the API is kept non-public).
